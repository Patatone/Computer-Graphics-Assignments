Shaders = are the pipeline components that compute the positions and the colors of the pixels on screen
corresponding to points of the objects

Uniform variables Blocks = Needed to pass elements (scene and mesh for example) to the shaders

Sets 	-> Group of Uniform variables, each one rappresents one level of frequency at which values are updated. Smaller id, changes less often.
Binding -> It Identifies the resource inside the Set

---------------------------------------------

Vertex shaders = It performs operations on each vertex.

Fragment shader = It determines the final color of each fragment.
It cannot directly access the attributes associated with a vertex.

---------------------------------------------

Command Buffers = It stores Vulkan operations. Each queue may handle several command buffers, to allow different threads running
on separate cores recording commands in parallel.

Command Pools = groups of Command Buffers

---------------------------------------------

Swap chain = It is essentially a queue of images that are waiting to be presented to the screen.
It's needed to handle Screen Synchronization.

Image Views = It describes how to access the image and which part of the image to access

---------------------------------------------

Descriptor Layouts = They rappresents the "class" of the uniform variables, they specify:
- The type of descriptor
- The binding ID
- The stage in which this will be used

Pipeline Layout = It selects which of the available Descriptor Layouts will be accessed in that specific pipeline.
It specify the Set ID of the Descriptor

Descriptor Sets = They are the Instances of the uniform data, they define the values that will be passed to the uniforms.
We need at least a Descriptor Set for each different value assigned to a Uniform.

Descriptor Pools = groups of Descriptor Sets. Similar at what we have seen for Command Pools
